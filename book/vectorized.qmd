# Vectorized plots

When we say "vectorized", it means that you can pass in a vector
of `x` or `y` and you'll get back  a list of plots

```{r}
pm_scatter(
  df, 
  x = "TIME", 
  y = c("RES", "WRES", "CWRES")
)
```

Note that we typically use `pm_grid()` to arrange the plots

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-heigth: 5
pm_scatter(
  df, 
  x = "TIME", 
  y = c("RES", "WRES", "CWRES")
) %>% pm_grid(ncol = 2)
```

`pm_grid()` uses the excellent `patchwork` package to arrange 
a list of plots into some sort of grid.
