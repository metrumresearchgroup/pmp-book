<img src=pmp-hex.png align=right width=150px></img>This is a simple 
introduction to the pmplots package for R. I hope this will be useful for 
those who are new to the package and those who just need a  reminder on the 
syntax. The goal with this package isn't to create a new grammar of graphics, 
but rather to create a standard set of commonly-used plots in pharmacometrics 
analyses. 

This is truly intended to be a Gallery. In some chapters, you will see a great 
deal of repetition in plots (like CWRES versus TIME, WRES versus TIME, 
RES versus TIME). This is by design with the intention to make the reader aware
of the different functions available in the package. One exception to this 
is the page on [customization](custom.html). Please take a moment to look through 
this page; it is long but you will find some very helpful examples of what 
you can do with pmplots.
